## [Read the manual](https://rangeengine.tech/api/14/html/manual/tutorials/range_armor/index.html)

RangeArmor is a Range Game Engine tool that allows you to package your game data files and launch them separated from the standalone player executable. It's available on Windows and Linux.

This project is a fork of BGArmor with the objective of improving the system for the range engine. It also features a project development structure to aid the game development workflow and ease the release process.

RangeArmor also aims to provide a toolchain of tasks to automate the process of game release, including tasks to package the game data files and generate releases, a launcher and blenderplayer icon changer (on Windows) and others.

### Note About Licensing
RangeArmor is under the MIT license and does not include any RangeEngine components, unlike BGArmor, RangeArmor does not obfuscate the project and keeps it Open-Source. In short, you won't have any complications with the [GPL license](https://download.blender.org/release/GPL3-license.txt) when releasing your games.
