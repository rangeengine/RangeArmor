## About
RangeArmor is a Range Game Engine tool that allows you to package your game data files and launch them separated from the standalone player executable; is available on Windows and Linux.

This project is a fork of [BGArmor](https://github.com/bgempire/bgarmor), with the objective of improving the system for the Range Engine; it also features a project development structure, to aid the game development workflow and ease the release process.

RangeArmor also aims to provide a toolchain of tasks to automate the process of game release, including:
  - Package the game data files and generate releases
  - Change the RangeRuntime icon (on Windows)
  - A launcher to run the game
  - And more

## Manual
